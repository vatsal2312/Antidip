I will like to modify this contract. https://bscscan.com/address/0x9b76D1B12Ff738c113200EB043350022EBf12Ff0#code


i want to add maximum sellable which should be 95% of the total wallet balance.
that means you cant sell or transfer more than 95% of your balance at once.

then the remaining balance, you can still sell but still maximum of 95% of the balance.



Also, this contract has 3% extra fees on sell orders.

we want to make it 10%more making a total of 25% fee on sells.

The contract currently has this for sell orders :
18% (12% BNB redistribution + 6% Liquidity pool)


We want 12% BNB redistribution + 8% Liquidity pool + 5% to burn address


and also, we want to change the total supply to 1 million
